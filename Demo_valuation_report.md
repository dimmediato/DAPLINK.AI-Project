### Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE) Calculation

The Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE) is a critical metric for valuing owner-operated businesses, as it represents the total financial benefit an owner-operator would derive from the business. It is calculated by starting with pre-tax net profit and adding back expenses that are considered discretionary or non-recurring to a new owner.

| Description                     | Amount        |
| :------------------------------ | :------------ |
| Net Profit (Pre-Tax)            | $673,179      |
| Owner Salary (Excess over Market) | $60,000       |
| Owner Perks                     | $18,000       |
| Interest Expense                | $12,000       |
| Depreciation                    | $36,000       |
| Amortization                    | $4,000        |
| Non-Recurring Expenses          | $7,000        |
| **Total SDE**                   | **$806,179**  |

### SDE Add-back Justifications

Each add-back to Net Profit (Pre-Tax) in the SDE calculation is justified as follows:

#### Net Profit (Pre-Tax): $673,179
*   **Justification:** This figure is derived from the practice's Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA), adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation and interest expense, reflecting the operating profit before non-operational adjustments.

#### Owner Salary (Excess over Market): $60,000
*   **Justification:** Owner compensation paid above what would be considered a fair market salary for a practicing dentist in a similar role is normalized as an add-back. This adjustment ensures the SDE accurately reflects the true operating profit available to a new owner who would likely pay themselves a market-rate salary.

#### Owner Perks: $18,000
*   **Justification:** Personal benefits, such as vehicle expenses, personal travel, or club memberships, that are paid by the practice but primarily benefit the owner rather than the business, are added back. These are expenses a new owner would typically not incur or would integrate into their personal finances.

#### Interest Expense: $12,000
*   **Justification:** Interest expense is added back because a buyer will typically secure new financing for the acquisition, making the existing debt structure and associated interest payments irrelevant to the future financial performance under new ownership.

#### Depreciation: $36,000
*   **Justification:** Depreciation is a non-cash expense that accounts for the reduction in value of tangible assets over time. Since it does not represent an actual outflow of funds from the business, it is added back to determine the practice's true cash-generating ability.

#### Amortization: $4,000
*   **Justification:** Similar to depreciation, amortization is a non-cash expense that accounts for the systematic reduction in value of intangible assets (e.g., goodwill, patents) over time. It is added back for the same reason as depreciation, to reflect the cash flow available to an owner.

#### Non-Recurring Expenses: $7,000
*   **Justification:** These are one-time adjustments for expenses that are not expected to recur under new ownership. Examples include large, infrequent repairs, legal fees for specific past events, or other unusual costs that do not reflect the ongoing operational expenses of the practice.

## Valuation Methodology

The valuation of Demo Dental NYC is primarily conducted using the Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE) multiple methodology, which is widely regarded as the most appropriate approach for valuing small to mid-sized owner-operated businesses, such as dental practices. This method effectively captures the total discretionary cash flow available to a single owner-operator. To provide a comprehensive perspective and cross-validate the SDE-derived valuation, supplementary analyses utilizing EBITDA and Revenue multiples have also been considered.

### Valuation Multiples Applied

Based on prevailing market conditions for dental practice sales, comparable transaction data, and considering the specific financial profile and risk attributes of Demo Dental NYC (e.g., strong FFS patient base, consistent revenue, modern facilities), the following industry-standard multiples have been applied:

*   For the **SDE-based valuation**, a range of 3.5x to 5.5x SDE has been utilized. This range reflects the practice's strong profitability, established patient base, and favorable market position.
*   For the **EBITDA-based valuation**, a multiple of 4.5x has been applied.
*   For the **Revenue-based valuation**, a multiple of 0.8x has been applied.

| Valuation Method        | Multiple | Calculation                     | Implied Value   |
| :---------------------- | :------- | :------------------------------ | :-------------- |
| SDE (Low End)           | 3.5x     | $806,179 (SDE) x 3.5            | $2,821,627      |
| SDE (High End)          | 5.5x     | $806,179 (SDE) x 5.5            | $4,433,985      |
| EBITDA                  | 4.5x     | $721,179 (EBITDA) x 4.5         | $3,245,306      |
| Revenue                 | 0.8x     | $1,632,400 (Revenue) x 0.8      | $1,305,920      |

The SDE and EBITDA multiple approaches provide the most relevant valuation insights for an owner-operated dental practice, reflecting the practice's profitability and cash flow generation. The Revenue multiple serves as a high-level cross-reference, typically yielding a lower value as it does not account for operational efficiency or profitability margins. The overall valuation range primarily relies on the SDE and EBITDA multiples, which are more indicative of the intrinsic value for a prospective owner-operator.

## Key Assumptions

The valuation presented in this report is contingent upon several key assumptions that are standard in dental practice valuations and are critical for assessing the investment's viability.

### Debt Service and Tax Rate

*   **Annual Debt Service (Buyer's Projection):** $168,000
*   **Buyer's Effective Tax Rate:** 25% (0.25)

These figures are crucial for a prospective buyer to accurately assess the post-acquisition cash flow, debt repayment capacity, and overall investment viability. It is assumed that the buyer will finance the acquisition, incurring the projected annual debt service. The effective tax rate is applied to the buyer's projected taxable income to estimate post-tax earnings.

Additional key assumptions include:
*   **Operational Continuity:** The valuation assumes that the practice will maintain its current patient volume, revenue streams, and operational efficiency under new ownership. It is also assumed that there is potential for growth through strategic initiatives by a motivated new owner.
*   **Staff Retention:** A critical assumption is the retention of key staff members following the acquisition. The continued presence of experienced hygienists, dental assistants, and administrative personnel is essential for seamless operational transition and maintaining patient relationships.
*   **Market Stability:** The valuation presumes a stable economic environment and consistent demand for dental services in the Midtown Manhattan area, without unforeseen significant market disruptions.
*   **Asset Condition:** It is assumed that all practice assets, including equipment and technology, are in good working order and do not require immediate significant capital expenditure beyond routine maintenance.
