# DAPLINK.AI-Project
First Pipeline: data input and JSON output. Second Pipeline: rag (retrieval-augmented generation) need the input of some report, prompt engineering. Third pipeline: dashboard (linked to second pipeline)

Core Product Functionality:
DAPLINK offers an automated valuation tool for dental clinics. The current version is a demo app that visualizes key revenue metrics to provide an overview of a clinic's financial health and estimated value. More valuation-assistance features are planned for future releases.

Target Audience and Problem Solved:
The tool is designed for dental practice buyers—both investors and current clinic operators—who need a fast, low-cost way to assess a clinic’s value before acquisition. DAPLINK aims to simplify and expedite what is traditionally a slow and expensive valuation process.

Current Development Focus:
Internally, the team is focused on mapping and integrating data from Google Drive into the app’s data format to support the current visualization system and lay the groundwork for future enhancements.

Long-Term Vision:
DAPLINK intends to grow into a comprehensive platform for dental practices—combining valuation, operational analytics, and a doctor-exclusive MLS (Multiple Listing Service) for buying and selling practices without the need for brokers.

Main Project Focus Right Now:
1. The immediate priority is cleaning and mapping external data (from Drive) into the app’s existing structure to support better visualizations and more efficient feature development.

2. Creating visualizations based on cleaned data using Retool to demonstrate an example of the third pipeline and actionable insights.

3. Creating an OCR script to properly extract standard discretionary earnings from Tax Return documents and Profit and Loss documents, in order to calculate addbacks.
