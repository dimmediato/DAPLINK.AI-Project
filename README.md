# DAPLINK.AI-Project

## Project Overview
DAPLINK aims to become the comprehensive platform for dental practice transactionsâ€”combining traditional BI tools, AI-powered analysis, and a broker-free marketplace. The platform will seamlessly integrate pre-built analytics dashboards with intelligent Q&A capabilities, providing users with both structured and exploratory data analysis options.

## Current Development Focus
The immediate priority is completing the web platform that will serve as the unified interface for all DAPLINK features, bringing together the Retool dashboards, LLM analysis system, and future marketplace functionality into a single, cohesive user experience.

## Core Product Functionality
DAPLINK offers an automated valuation tool for dental clinics with:
- **Business Intelligence Dashboards** (Retool) for comprehensive practice analytics
- **LLM-powered Q&A system** that analyzes real practice data
- **Interactive visualizations** that provide actionable insights
- **Web platform** (currently in development) to integrate all components

## Target Audience and Problem Solved
The tool is designed for:
- **Dental practice buyers** (investors and operators) who need fast, accurate practice valuations
- **Practice owners** seeking to understand their practice performance and value
- **Brokers and consultants** who need data-driven insights for their clients

DAPLINK simplifies what is traditionally a slow, expensive valuation process by automating data analysis and providing instant insights through both traditional BI tools and AI-powered analysis.

## Current System Architecture

### Phase 1: Business Intelligence Foundation (Completed)
- **Technology Stack**: 
  - PostgreSQL database for data storage
  - SQL queries for data transformation and analysis
  - Retool for interactive dashboard creation
- **Dashboards Created**:
  - **Productivity Visualizations**: 
    - Summary tables (total production, patients seen, average visit fee)
    - Provider collections and adjustments analysis
    - Pie charts and line graphs for trend analysis
  - **Procedures Analytics**:
    - Frequency and revenue tables
    - Service-specific analysis (e.g., Bitewing procedures)
    - Provider distribution pie charts
    - Bar graphs for procedure revenue
- **Purpose**: These Retool dashboards served as the visual blueprint for what the LLM system should generate programmatically

### Phase 2: LLM-Powered Analysis System (Current Production)
- **Technology**: OpenRouter API with DeepSeek model
- **Data Pipeline**:
  1. **Input Layer**: CSV files (productivity_2022_2025_all, procedures_2022_2025_all) + JSON configuration
  2. **Processing Layer**: Pandas DataFrames with automatic cleaning and standardization
  3. **Analysis Layer**: LLM interprets questions and generates insights from actual data
  4. **Visualization Layer**: Dynamic Plotly charts matching Retool dashboard styles
- **Capabilities**:
  - Natural language question processing
  - Provider-specific analysis
  - Trend analysis with year-over-year comparisons
  - Comparative analytics across providers
  - Intelligent insights and recommendations

### Phase 3: Web Platform Integration (Currently in Development)
- **Frontend Development**: Building the user-facing website where all components will live
- **Integration Goals**:
  - Embed Retool dashboards directly into the web platform
  - Integrate LLM Q&A interface for natural language queries
  - Unified authentication and data management
  - Seamless switching between BI dashboards and AI analysis
- **User Experience**: Single platform where users can both explore pre-built dashboards and ask custom questions

### LLM Query System
***Load practice data from multiple sources***

practice_data = DentalPracticeData(
    json_file_path="demo_clinic.json",
    productivity_csv="CSVs/productivity_2022_2025_all.csv",
    procedures_csv="CSVs/procedures_2022_2025_all.csv"
)

***Ask complex analytical questions***

question = "What is the productivity trend for Harvey Seybold, DDS?"
result = process_question_with_visualizations(question, practice_data)

***Get AI-powered analysis with visualization***

print(result['answer'])  # Detailed analysis with insights
